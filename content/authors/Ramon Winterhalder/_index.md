<!-- ## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Physics Department at the University of Milan. My research lies at the intersection of particle physics and machine learning. I aim to advance data-driven techniques in high-energy physics and to enhance traditional simulation methods using (generative) neural networks. My interests also include simulation-based inference, which crucially depends on first-principles simulations and precision theoretical calculations. -->
