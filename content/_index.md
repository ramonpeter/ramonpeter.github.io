      text: |-
        I am a postdoctoral researcher at the intersection of particle physics and machine learning. My research aims to fully establish data-driven techniques in high-energy physics and to enhance standard simulation methods with (generative) neural networks. In particular, I am interested in:
        - Generative models
        - Explainable and interpretable AI
        - Simulation-based inference
        - Monte Carlo generators
        - Higher-order calculations
        - PDF fits

        Please reach out if you are interested to collaborate!
