abstract: Differentiable programming opens exciting new avenues in particle physics, also affecting future event generators. These new techniques boost the performance of current and planned MadGraph implementations. Combining phase-space mappings with a set of very small learnable flow elements, MadNIS-Lite, can improve the sampling efficiency while being physically interpretable. This defines a third sampling strategy, complementing VEGAS and the full MadNIS.
